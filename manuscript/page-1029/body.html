I've been a fool myself in my time, but that's between you and me. I shan't thrust myself on him only keep my eye on him, and see that he gets some good food, and put in a word here and there.”</p><p>“Then,” said Mr. Irwine, reassured a little as to Bartle's discretion, “I think you'll be doing a good deed; and it will be well for you to let Adam's mother and brother know that you're going.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, yes,” said Bartle, rising, and taking off his spectacles, “I'll do that, I'll do that; though the mother's a whimpering thing—I don't like to come within earshot of her; however, she's a straight-backed, clean woman, none of your slatterns. I wish you good-bye, sir, and thank you for the time you've spared me. You're everybody's friend in this business—everybody's friend. It's a heavy weight you've got on your shoulders.”</p></div> </div>
