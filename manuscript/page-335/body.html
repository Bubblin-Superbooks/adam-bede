Have you seen anything in the wood? Don't be frightened—I'll take care of you now.”</p><p>Hetty was blushing so, she didn't know whether she was happy or miserable. To be crying again—what did gentlemen think of girls who cried in that way? She felt unable even to say “no,” but could only look away from him and wipe the tears from her cheek. Not before a great drop had fallen on her rose-coloured strings—she knew that quite well.</p><p>“Come, be cheerful again. Smile at me, and tell me what's the matter. Come, tell me.”</p><p>Hetty turned her head towards him, whispered, “I thought you wouldn't come,” and slowly got courage to lift her eyes to him.
