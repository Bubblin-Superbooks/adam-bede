<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">something passing the love of women as I feel for you, for I could be content without your marrying me if I could go and live at Snowfield and be near you. I trusted as the strong love God has given me towards you was a leading for us both; but it seems it was only meant for my trial. Perhaps I feel more for you than I ought to feel for any creature, for I often can't help saying of you what the hymn says—</p><blockquote><p>   In darkest shades if she appear,
   My dawning is begun;
   She is my soul's bright morning-star,
   And she my rising sun.</p></blockquote><p>That may be wrong, and I am to be taught better. But you wouldn't be displeased with me if things turned out so as I could leave this country and go to live at Snowfield?”</p></div> </div>
