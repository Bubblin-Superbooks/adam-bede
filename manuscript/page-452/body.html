Have you got nothing better to think on this good Sunday as poor old Thias Bede's to be put into the ground, and him drownded i' th' dead o' the night, as it's enough to make one's back run cold, but you must be 'dizening yourself as if there was a wedding i'stid of a funeral?”</p><p>“Well, Aunt,” said Hetty, “I can't be ready so soon as everybody else, when I've got Totty's things to put on. And I'd ever such work to make her stand still.”</p></div> </div>
