Are you the gentleman that stayed to listen on horseback?”</p><p>“Yes. Why do you want to go into the prison?”</p><p>“I want to go to Hetty Sorrel, the young woman who has been condemned to death—and to stay with her, if I may be permitted.

My own aunt married her uncle, Martin Poyser. But I was away at Leeds, and didn't know of this great trouble in time to get here before to-day. I entreat you, sir, for the love of our heavenly Father, to let me go to her and stay with her.”</p><p>“How did you know she was condemned to death, if you are only just come from Leeds?”</p></div> </div>
