When folks have got an honourable independent spirit, they don't like to do anything that might make 'em seem base-minded.”</p><p>“But no one who knows you will think that, Adam. That is not a reason strong enough against a course that is really more generous, more unselfish than the other. And it will be known—it shall be made known, that both you and the Poysers stayed at my entreaty. Adam, don't try to make things worse for me; I'm punished enough without that.”</p></div> </div>
