I think it is the most charming room I know. I should like every farmer's wife to come and look at it for a pattern.”</p><p>“Oh, you're pleased to say so, sir. Pray take a seat,” said Mrs. Poyser, relieved a little by this compliment and the captain's evident good-humour, but still glancing anxiously at Mr. Irwine, who, she saw, was looking at Dinah and advancing towards her.</p><p>“Poyser is not at home, is he?” said Captain Donnithorne, seating himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy-door.</p><p>“No, sir, he isn't; he's gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West, the factor, about the wool. But there's Father i' the barn, sir, if he'd be of any use.”</p></div> </div>
