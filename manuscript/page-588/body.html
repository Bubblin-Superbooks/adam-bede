I've been at the Hall Farm, and they always have their supper betimes, you know: they don't keep your late hours.”</p><p>“I know little about their hours,” said Bartle dryly, cutting his bread and not shrinking from the crust. “It's a house I seldom go into, though I'm fond of the boys, and Martin Poyser's a good fellow. There's too many women in the house for me: I hate the sound of women's voices; they're always either a-buzz or a-squeak—always either a-buzz or a-squeak. Mrs. Poyser keeps at the top o' the talk like a fife; and as for the young lasses, I'd as soon look at water-grubs. I know what they'll turn to—stinging gnats, stinging gnats. Here, take some ale, my boy: it's been drawn for you—it's been drawn for you.”</p></div> </div>
