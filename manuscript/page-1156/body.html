I used to wish I could do it, in my passion—but that was when I thought you didn't feel enough. I'll stay, sir, I'll do the best I can. It's all I've got to think of now—to do my work well and make the world a bit better place for them as can enjoy it.”</p><p>“Then we'll part now, Adam. You will see Mr. Irwine to-morrow, and consult with him about everything.”</p><p>“Are you going soon, sir?” said Adam.</p><p>“As soon as possible—after I've made the necessary arrangements. Good-bye, Adam. I shall think of you going about the old place.”</p><p>“Good-bye, sir. God bless you.”</p><p>The hands were clasped once more, and Adam left the Hermitage, feeling that sorrow was more bearable now hatred was gone.</p></div> </div>
